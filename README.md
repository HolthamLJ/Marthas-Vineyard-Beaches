## Marthas Vineyard Beaches 
Welcome to my first ever web map! 
In this lab my peers and I were assigned to create a path from point A to point B with additional points of interest inbetween.

## Requirments 
To complete the lab, there was a minimum of 4 points of interest inbetween point A, the Steamship Authority in Vineyard Haven and point B, The Steamship Authority in Oak Bluffs.
I went ahead and added an additional point C, The Marthas Vineyard Aiport.
This was to showcase the points of access to the island.
Additionally, I made sure to highlight the public mode of transportation that you can take through my route, being the public bus system on the island. This bus system has routes that will take you to all of my favorite public beaches. 
Included in the map is pictures to show what lies at these beaches as well as address descriptions if you were to use your own method of transportation. 

## I hope this map brings some useful infomation and furthermore I hope you enjoy my creation!
